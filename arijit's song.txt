Jise zindagi dhoondh rahi hai
Kya ye woh makaam mera hai
Yahaan chain se bas ruk jaaun
Kyunki teri hai ye meri zameen

Jise meri manzil dhoondh rahi hai
Kya wo woh makaam mera hai
Yahaan sabhi hain tu hai kahaan
Main jeet gaya

Aur zindagi tujhse kuchh mangti hai
Yeh shammaa jo jal rahi hai
Yahaan har shaakh pe ullu baitha hai
Anjaane hi tere nishaan

Mujhko le chal yun
Jahaan le chalein
Ye rastein
Hain patharon ki aahat
Ye umar hai kya
Ek pal mein guzar jaaye
Yeh aaj ka hai, ya kal ka hai

Jise zindagi dhoondh rahi hai
Kya ye woh makaam mera hai
Yahaan chain se bas ruk jaaun
Kyunki teri hai ye meri zameen

Translation:

Is this the place that I've been searching for all my life
Can I rest here peacefully now that I've found my own piece of land

Is this the destination that I've been looking for all this while
Is this where everyone is, where are you
I have won and conquered

And life asks you for something
The candle that's burning
Here, every branch has an owl sitting on it
Unknown, are your signs

Take me away
To wherever you want to
These roads
Are filled with the sound of stones
What is this age
Can it all pass by in a moment
Is this for today, or for tomorrow

Is this the place that I've been searching for all my life
Can I rest here peacefully now that I've found my own piece of land.
